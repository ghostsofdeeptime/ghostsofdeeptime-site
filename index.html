<h2>Exploring Lost Civilisations Before History</h2>
<p>Ghosts of Deep Time invites you to imagine a lost civilisation — one that may have walked the Earth between 2 million and 500,000 years ago — and asks what traces might still live in our bodies, stories, and dreams.</p>
<p>This is not a theory. It’s a meditation. A question. A ghost-story rooted in geology, myth, and evolutionary memory. The kind of story that doesn’t rewrite history — but quietly reframes how we remember it.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Reflections from Deep Time</h2>

  <!-- First visible blog 1 -->
  <div class="blog-entry">
    <h3>Blog: Why I Wrote This Book</h3>
    <p>I didn’t plan to write this book — it arrived like a half-remembered story. <em>Ghosts of Deep Time</em> began with a question that wouldn’t leave me: What if there was a civilisation before everything we’ve ever called civilisation?</p>
    <p>I wasn’t looking to rewrite history. But I was drawn to the idea that something might have happened — between 2 million and 500,000 years ago — something we’ve forgotten not because it didn’t happen, but because we no longer know how to remember it.</p>
    <p>The traces wouldn’t be monuments. They’d be quieter: a curve in a stone, a shape in a story, a dream that keeps returning.</p>
    <p>I wrote this book to follow those traces — not to a theory, but to a feeling. Something older than facts. Something still alive beneath us. Maybe you’ve felt it too.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- First visible blog 2 -->
  <div class="blog-entry">
    <h3>Blog: Was There a Civilisation Before History?</h3>
    <p>We tell ourselves that history began with writing — with tablets and temples and kings. But what if that’s not where the real story starts?</p>
    <p>Long before the Sumerians and the pyramids, before we etched meaning into stone, there were beings who stood and watched the sky. Hominids. Humans, almost. Or maybe just human enough to remember.</p>
    <p>The bones remain — but what about their memory? What did they believe, pass down, bury, whisper into stone?</p>
    <p>Modern archaeology gives us fragments. But myth gives us echoes. Dreams give us clues. Across the world, stories of a time before time linger — of a flood, of giants, of a world lost not to war, but to forgetting.</p>
    <p>Could there have been a civilisation before history? Not a high-tech Atlantis — but something older, stranger. A culture of silence. A civilisation of meaning, not machines.</p>
    <p><em>Ghosts of Deep Time</em> doesn’t try to prove this. It invites you to imagine it. To remember what you never knew. To feel the weight of the unrecorded.</p>

      <h3>Blog: What Is Deep Time — And Why Might It Remember?</h3>
      <p>Deep time is not just old time. It’s a silence so long it becomes something else.</p>
      <p>It stretches across millions of years, where memory has no page, and history has no pen. But maybe, just maybe, something remembers.</p>
      <p>Not in words. Not in facts. But in the curve of a river. The shape of a tool. The pulse of a myth.</p>
      <p>Deep time might hold the memory of hands that shaped without leaving mark. Voices that spoke only in ritual. Cultures that vanished not by catastrophe — but by becoming the earth again.</p>
      <p>Evolution teaches us survival. But stories — even unspoken ones — may survive too. We inherit them in feelings, in intuitions, in the way some dreams feel older than bone.</p>
      <p><em>Ghosts of Deep Time</em> is not about finding proof. It’s about following feeling. Listening backward. And maybe… remembering something the world has buried for us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-entry">
      <h3>Blog: Books Like Graham Hancock — But With Poetry Instead of Proof</h3>
      <p>Some books try to rewrite history. Others just invite you to remember what it forgot.</p>
      <p>If you’ve read Graham Hancock or watched <em>Ancient Apocalypse</em>, you’ve probably felt it — that pull toward a deeper story. A missing chapter beneath the ruins. A whisper that says: <em>Something happened here.</em></p>
      <p>But <em>Ghosts of Deep Time</em> isn’t here to argue. It doesn’t fight over timelines. It doesn’t need evidence.</p>
      <p>It asks a different kind of question:</p>
      <blockquote>What if there was a civilisation before ours — not built of stone, but of story?</blockquote>
      <p>This is a book for those who feel echoes in the landscape. For those who’ve wondered about the space between fossils and myth. For those who don’t need proof to feel something is missing.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking for books like Graham Hancock, but with poetry instead of proof — this might be the one you didn’t know you needed.</p>

      <p><strong>What are Anemoforms?</strong><br/>Anemoforms are fragments of memory shaped by absence...</p>
      <p><strong>Why did you create the Anemoforms?</strong><br/>At first, I wanted to illustrate the moments more directly...</p>
      <p><strong>Why are the Anemoforms so abstract?</strong><br/>Because the world they hint at isn’t fully knowable...</p>
      <p><strong>Can the Anemoforms change depending on who looks at them?</strong><br/>Yes — and they’re meant to...</p>
      <p><strong>What emotions do you hope the Anemoforms evoke?</strong><br/>A sense of wonder. A sense of loss...</p>
