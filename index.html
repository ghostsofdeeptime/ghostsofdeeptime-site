<h2>Exploring Lost Civilisations Before History</h2>
<p>Ghosts of Deep Time invites you to imagine a lost civilisation — one that may have walked the Earth between 2 million and 500,000 years ago — and asks what traces might still live in our bodies, stories, and dreams.</p>
<p>This is not a theory. It’s a meditation. A question. A ghost-story rooted in geology, myth, and evolutionary memory. The kind of story that doesn’t rewrite history — but quietly reframes how we remember it.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Reflections from Deep Time</h2>

  <!-- First visible blog 1 -->
  <div class="blog-entry">
    <h3>Blog: Why I Wrote This Book</h3>
    <p>I didn’t plan to write this book — it arrived like a half-remembered story. <em>Ghosts of Deep Time</em> began with a question that wouldn’t leave me: What if there was a civilisation before everything we’ve ever called civilisation?</p>
    <p>I wasn’t looking to rewrite history. But I was drawn to the idea that something might have happened — between 2 million and 500,000 years ago — something we’ve forgotten not because it didn’t happen, but because we no longer know how to remember it.</p>
    <p>The traces wouldn’t be monuments. They’d be quieter: a curve in a stone, a shape in a story, a dream that keeps returning.</p>
    <p>I wrote this book to follow those traces — not to a theory, but to a feeling. Something older than facts. Something still alive beneath us. Maybe you’ve felt it too.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- First visible blog 2 -->
  <div class="blog-entry">
    <h3>Blog: Was There a Civilisation Before History?</h3>
    <p>We tell ourselves that history began with writing — with tablets and temples and kings. But what if that’s not where the real story starts?</p>
    <p>Long before the Sumerians and the pyramids, before we etched meaning into stone, there were beings who stood and watched the sky. Hominids. Humans, almost. Or maybe just human enough to remember.</p>
    <p>The bones remain — but what about their memory? What did they believe, pass down, bury, whisper into stone?</p>
    <p>Modern archaeology gives us fragments. But myth gives us echoes. Dreams give us clues. Across the world, stories of a time before time linger — of a flood, of giants, of a world lost not to war, but to forgetting.</p>
    <p>Could there have been a civilisation before history? Not a high-tech Atlantis — but something older, stranger. A culture of silence. A civilisation of meaning, not machines.</p>
    <p><em>Ghosts of Deep Time</em> doesn’t try to prove this. It invites you to imagine it. To remember what you never knew. To feel the weight of the unrecorded.</p>

      <h3>Blog: What Is Deep Time — And Why Might It Remember?</h3>
      <p>Deep time is not just old time. It’s a silence so long it becomes something else.</p>
      <p>It stretches across millions of years, where memory has no page, and history has no pen. But maybe, just maybe, something remembers.</p>
      <p>Not in words. Not in facts. But in the curve of a river. The shape of a tool. The pulse of a myth.</p>
      <p>Deep time might hold the memory of hands that shaped without leaving mark. Voices that spoke only in ritual. Cultures that vanished not by catastrophe — but by becoming the earth again.</p>
      <p>Evolution teaches us survival. But stories — even unspoken ones — may survive too. We inherit them in feelings, in intuitions, in the way some dreams feel older than bone.</p>
      <p><em>Ghosts of Deep Time</em> is not about finding proof. It’s about following feeling. Listening backward. And maybe… remembering something the world has buried for us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-entry">
      <h3>Blog: Books Like Graham Hancock — But With Poetry Instead of Proof</h3>
      <p>Some books try to rewrite history. Others just invite you to remember what it forgot.</p>
      <p>If you’ve read Graham Hancock or watched <em>Ancient Apocalypse</em>, you’ve probably felt it — that pull toward a deeper story. A missing chapter beneath the ruins. A whisper that says: <em>Something happened here.</em></p>
      <p>But <em>Ghosts of Deep Time</em> isn’t here to argue. It doesn’t fight over timelines. It doesn’t need evidence.</p>
      <p>It asks a different kind of question:</p>
      <blockquote>What if there was a civilisation before ours — not built of stone, but of story?</blockquote>
      <p>This is a book for those who feel echoes in the landscape. For those who’ve wondered about the space between fossils and myth. For those who don’t need proof to feel something is missing.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking for books like Graham Hancock, but with poetry instead of proof — this might be the one you didn’t know you needed.</p>

  <h2>Questions & Answers</h2>
  <p><em>Before you step into the echoes, here are some questions you might be wondering. Whether you’re curious, cautious, or simply listening for something just beyond reach, these reflections are here to guide you. Take your time. Wander. Follow what calls to you.</em></p>

  <div class="qna-group">
    <button onclick="toggleQA('qa1')" class="qa-toggle">Before You Step Into the Memory</button>
    <div id="qa1" class="qa-content" style="display: none;">
      <p><strong>What inspired you to write Ghosts of Deep Time?</strong><br/>I kept seeing traces that didn’t fit. Stories that lingered longer than they should. Shapes that returned in dreams, myths, and geology. It felt like something was whispering just beneath history.</p>
      <p><strong>Why is Ghosts of Deep Time written in a poetic style?</strong><br/>Because this isn’t a story that can be told in facts alone. The language had to feel like memory, not just narrative.</p>
      <p><strong>Why is each chapter centred on a vignette?</strong><br/>Vignettes allow you to enter through feeling. They’re doors, not maps.</p>
      <p><strong>Why should I buy Ghosts of Deep Time?</strong><br/>Because it’s different. Because it speaks to something you’ve felt but never seen on the page. Because the echoes might already be calling you.</p>
      <p><strong>How structured is Ghosts of Deep Time?</strong><br/>It’s carefully arranged — even if it feels like wandering. There’s a shape underneath, like a fossil in soft earth.</p>
      <p><strong>What do you hope readers take away from the book?</strong><br/>That memory is bigger than we think. That not everything forgotten is lost. That history isn’t just behind us — it’s beneath us, around us, still speaking if we learn to listen.</p>
      <p><strong>Is this story meant to be taken literally?</strong><br/>Not always. Some truths arrive in metaphor first. That doesn’t make them less real.</p>
      <p><strong>Who would enjoy this book the most?</strong><br/>People who feel time strangely. People who believe myth has weight. People who dream about deep oceans and older skies.</p>
      <p><strong>Will Ghosts of Deep Time leave me with something to think about?</strong><br/>Yes. And maybe also something to feel. And maybe something to remember — even if you don’t know where from.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="qna-group">
    <button onclick="toggleQA('qa2')" class="qa-toggle">Shapes Carried by the Wind</button>
    <div id="qa2" class="qa-content" style="display: none;">
      <p><strong>What are Anemoforms?</strong><br/>They’re fragments of presence shaped by absence. Visual echoes of something that was, or might have been. They’re not illustrations — they’re impressions.</p>
      <p><strong>Why did you create the Anemoforms?</strong><br/>Because the book isn’t just about memory — it’s also about form, silence, and the shapes that remain. The Anemoforms hold that silence visually.</p>
      <p><strong>Why are the Anemoforms so abstract?</strong><br/>Because what they depict can’t be shown directly. It’s like trying to photograph a dream.</p>
      <p><strong>Can the Anemoforms change depending on who looks at them?</strong><br/>Yes. That’s part of the point. They’re incomplete — and your memory completes them.</p>
      <p><strong>What emotions do you hope the Anemoforms evoke?</strong><br/>Longing. Recognition. Curiosity. Stillness. Maybe even mourning — for something beautiful and ancient and almost known.</p>
      <p><strong>Will the Anemoforms evolve in the next books too?</strong><br/>Yes. The next books will explore presence and resonance — and the visuals will shift to reflect that. New forms, new echoes.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="qna-group">
    <button onclick="toggleQA('qa3')" class="qa-toggle">For the Ones Who Ask</button>
    <div id="qa3" class="qa-content" style="display: none;">
      <p><strong>Is Ghosts of Deep Time just pseudoscience or fantasy?</strong><br/>No. It’s not a theory — it’s an invitation. A feeling. A poetic speculation that respects both science and story without being limited by either.</p>
      <p><strong>Is this book political or tied to any ideology?</strong><br/>No. It doesn’t serve an agenda. It asks you to feel, not to follow.</p>
      <p><strong>Is this New Age or spiritual?</strong><br/>Not really. It’s mythic. It’s sensory. It’s rooted in the soil of imagination, not the sky of belief.</p>
      <p><strong>Is this book trying to sell a conspiracy theory?</strong><br/>Absolutely not. There’s no agenda, no hidden “truth,” no rejection of mainstream knowledge. Just an openness to the unknown.</p>
      <p><strong>Does this book require me to believe in anything supernatural?</strong><br/>No. Just believe in wonder. In mystery. In the power of story and the silence of time.</p>
      <p><strong>Is there scientific basis for any of this?</strong><br/>There are starting points — gaps, mysteries, anomalies. But the book doesn’t claim to solve them. It explores them differently: emotionally, mythically, poetically.</p>
      <p><strong>Why speculate at all? Why not just stick to facts?</strong><br/>Because facts are only part of the human experience. Speculation opens other doors — especially when handled with care and beauty.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="qna-group">
    <button onclick="toggleQA('qa4')" class="qa-toggle">The Path Ahead</button>
    <div id="qa4" class="qa-content" style="display: none;">
      <p><strong>Is Ghosts of Deep Time part of a series?</strong><br/>Yes. It’s the first in a poetic trilogy. The second explores the ghosts of the present. The third, the ghosts of the future.</p>
      <p><strong>What will the next books be about?</strong><br/>Book Two will explore resonance, presence, and how the past echoes through modern landscapes. Book Three will look forward — into warning, forgetting, and what we choose to preserve.</p>
      <p><strong>Will I need to read the next books to understand this one?</strong><br/>No. Each book stands alone — but they’re connected like echoes in a canyon.</p>
      <p><strong>Will reading the future books deepen my experience of this one?</strong><br/>Yes. They’ll circle back. Reflect. Reopen ideas and reveal new dimensions.</p>
      <p><strong>Will the next books stay in the same style?</strong><br/>Yes — but they’ll evolve. The form will grow with the themes. The voice will remain familiar, but the focus will shift.</p>
      <p><strong>Is it better to start now, or wait until all three books are out?</strong><br/>Start now. Memory doesn’t wait — and this story begins with you.</p>
      <p><strong>What connects all three books together?</strong><br/>Memory. Myth. Echo. Absence. Presence. A forgotten world and what it leaves behind.</p>
      <p><strong>Will I want to read the next books after this one?</strong><br/>Only if something stirs. If something calls. If some part of you wants to remember more than history offers.</p>

    <button onclick="toggleQA('qa5')" class="qa-toggle">If You’re Wondering About the Details</button>
    <div id="qa5" class="qa-content" style="display: none;">
      <p><strong>How long would it take the average reader to finish the book?</strong><br/>2–3 hours, depending on how slowly you move through the images and vignettes. It’s a book best read slowly, like walking a path at dusk.</p>
      <p><strong>Is this a good holiday or beach read?</strong><br/>Yes — if your holidays are for dreaming. It’s short, visual, and full of mystery.</p>
      <p><strong>Is this a good book for reading groups or book clubs?</strong><br/>Yes. It opens discussion. Not debate — but reflection. It’s ideal for groups that value questions more than conclusions.</p>
      <p><strong>Is it suitable for teenagers or young adults?</strong><br/>Yes — especially those interested in myth, nature, deep history, or mystery. Some younger teens might need guidance with the abstract style.</p>
      <p><strong>Is this a heavy or difficult read?</strong><br/>No. It’s gentle, lyrical, and intuitive. But it’s also deep — so it rewards slow reading and re-reading.</p>
